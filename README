Experiment @ KIT 2017
===========
These instructions for an experiment at KIT were translates and put into LaTex.


The Experiment
======
The experiment consists of \textbf{40 rounds}. In each round, you will be grouped with two other randomly selected participants in a \textbf{group of three}. It will not be revealed with whom you were grouped and new groups will be randomly formed every round. In each round, you have exactly \textbf{one decision} to make.


Experimental Procedure
======
The experiment with its 40 rounds is divided into \textbf{four sections} each consisting of 10 rounds: section 1 consists of rounds 1 - 10, section 2 consists of rounds 11 - 20, section 3 consists of rounds 21 - 30 and section 4 consists of rounds 31 - 40. ~\bigbreak
The sections differ only in the used \textbf{procurement procedure}. In all rounds in section 1 and section 3 (i.e. rounds 1-10 and 21 - 30) \textbf{procurement procedure 1} will be used. In all rounds in section 2 and section 4 (i.e. in rounds 11 - 20 and 31 - 40) \textbf{procurement procedure 2} will be used. The experiment informs you when a new section begins.

Decisions
======
In all 40 rounds, you represent a \textbf{company which produces one unit of a certain good} with the intention to sell. All participants (i.e. their companies) produce one unit of the same good and compete for selling their good only by setting a bid offer, respectively. At the beginning of each round, you will be informed of \textbf{your individual production costs of the good}. The costs are determined randomly and change every round. ~\bigbreak
In each of the 40 rounds, you can produce one unit of the good and sell it. Your decision consists of \textbf{submitting a bid offer for selling the unit}. \textbf{In each group, the three participants compete for selling two units of the good}. Therefore, in every round offers of only \textbf{two participants} per group are accepted. These two participants then produce the good and sell it at the \textbf{sales price} which \textbf{depends on the procurement procedure in use}. ~\bigbreak
If your offer is accepted, your \textbf{profit equals the sales price less your production costs}. If your offer is not accepted, you won't receive any payment, and no costs incur, as you do not produce the good, and hence, your profit equals zero.

Improvement suggestions (even if only for typos) can be
* can be either directly pushed into this repo

I'm going to try to implement all suggestions and improvements as soon as possible.
